# vn-annotation
Collection of all VerbNet class annotation. These are the pointers to the text, the word tokens, and the verbnet classes. We are unable to release the actual texts, as they fall under various licenses and domains. We are currently investigating solutions to provide all the annotations in the most practical, useful manner.

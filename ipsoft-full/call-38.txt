br	Here we are able to get good looks at Black Cuckoo, Grey Cuckooshrike, Forest Canary and, after a good bit of effort, the elusive Barratt's Warbler, a  bird  that < calls > loudly but insists on remaining hidden inside its favoured dense shrubbery. 
br	Our early arrival at the site pays off when we hear the  birds   <calling > from the cliffs above and watch a pair of them fly off to their feeding grounds (ironically, Roland and Eric had more or less the same view of its Gambian cousin in 1998). 
br	In the afternoon we entered the park via a different gate where we then spent the rest of the afternoon trying to see the rare and secretive Austral Rail . A  bird   <called > very close to the reed edge and eventually Roger and Alex got brief views as it showed for just a second or two. 
br	Way out in the wilderness a cold  coyote   <calls > Your eyes fix on the shotgun that's hangin' on the wall. 
br	It looked like we were going to get off to a good start when a pair of Streak-backed Antshrikes began calling nearby, but half an hour of crawling through the undergrowth with the  birds   <calling > around us did not even yield a glimpse. 
br	Frustration was setting in but we tried the clearing area again where another  bird  was < calling > distantly and this time we managed to enjoy good views of a striking pair of this sometimes tricky species in the middle level of the stunted forest. 
br	After 30 minutes or so we found our target bird, a Great Snipe . The  birds  started < calling > shortly after we arrived and the wait had been tense, but we were rewarded with some very good views of this much sought after species. 
br	We walked a hundred yards and there we found two  birds   <calling > to each other - superb! 
br	Afterwards we drove up into the mountains stopping on occasions when we heard  birds   <calling >. 
br	Our walk to the first hide was initially a little frustrating as we could hear  birds   <calling > but they all seemed to be high up in the canopy. 
br	At the oxbow lake, we saw a pair of Blue-crowned Trogons and a party of 4 Chestnut-eared Aracari in a tree behind some roosting Hoatzins . Then Ramiro heard a  bird   <calling > in the jungle behind us and we eventually saw a crippling Thrush-like Antpitta . It came right out into an open area and just stood motionless for several minutes. 
br	Dusk was falling as we boarded, and no other new species were added, although as we set sail I could hear some unknown wader species (on return home I played the calls of Stonecurlew and Senegal Thick Knee and was able to state clearly that the  bird  I heard < call > several times after dark as we got ready to sail was the latter species), and various heron species at nest or roost sites. 02/05/06 Sailing over night upstream to the South, awoke at dawn at about 5.45am, and enjoyed birding from room and on deck until we passes through the lock at Esna at 09.00am. 
br	Many  birds  were herd < calling > or singing, and some seemed pretty common, but getting to grips with them on the move was difficult...I regretted not having listened to tapes of some of the commoner birds before setting off, as some of the calls and songs are memorable. 
br	GREENSHANK (1) single  bird  heard < calling > from boat at dusk, and called in towards us. 
br	Despite the long journey, we had enough energy to get a meal in Orosi village and on the walk back heard a  bird   <calling > from inside the little thermal resort which adjoins the lodge, which we decided might be a nightjar species, probably Common Pauraque. 15/02/03 Orosi Lodge - Irazu Volcano - Tapanti National Park Waking up just before dawn here was a magical experience which perhaps can only happen once to a birdwatcher. 
br	However, the next several hours were very frustrating, as we were unable to see the  birds  yet they < called > around us. 
br	The smell of the dust they kicked up was rich and satisfying; out of thick orchards on either side the road,  birds   <called > and whistled to them cheerily; good-natured wayfarers, passing them, gave them 'Good-day,' or stopped to say nice things about their beautiful cart; and rabbits, sitting at their front doors in the hedgerows, held up their fore-paws, and said, 'O my! 
br	It is then that we can enter into antiphony with them; with practice, taking care to keep our communion heart-centred, we will find that the  birds   <call > back in answer to us. 
br	This site is signposted east from the E568 northbound just north of the railway on the edge of the industrial zone of Port de Bouc Les Destet This is a reliable site for Eagle Owl and we heard a  bird   <calling > on each occasion we visited.

br	On the evening of the 19th we heard the maniacal call from the vicinity of the 'green sign' around 2km above the Gap along the road leading to Fraser's Hill and the following morning the  bird  was still < calling >. 
br	On calling the bird would stop walking, crouch, lean forward and blow out the blue skin on the s ides of the neck (which was only visible when the  bird   <called >) whilst tilting its head from side to side. 
br	Absolutely mindblowing ! On our final evening at Taman Negara a  bird  was heard < calling > at close range near the drinking pool along the Jenet Muda trail but unfortunately another person walked along the trail at the wrong time - needless to say the only other person seen along the trail that evening. 1293. 
br	Once again we crossed the dry riverbed from the base shelter and spent a number of hours sitting and waiting in the hope of seeing a Schneider's Pitta but only succeeded in hearing two  birds   <calling >. 
br	A second  bird   <called > nearby. 
br	On the way we heard another Sumatran Peacock Pheasant but frustratingly only got a brief view of the vegetation moving in the area where the  bird  was < calling > from. 
br	Further along the track a second  bird  was < calling > and it too would not show despite being very close at times. 
br	Hooded Pitta Pitta sordida A single  bird  heard < calling > at Way Kambas on our last morning there. 133. 
br	Long-billed Wren Babbler Rimator malacoptilus Single  bird  heard < calling > down the valley along the small river at Gunung Kerinci and two birds eventually seen in this area the next day. 
br	We tried again for the latter at the village of Mahena near Tahuna in plantation/forest edge habitat where the bird has been seen in the past but again no  birds  were < calling >. 
br	The  coyotes  began <calling> in the middle of the night, startling all the campers.

br	133.1 Spiny Babbler (Turdoides nipalensis) Heard only at the usual site above Godaveri; 2  birds   <calling > but they remained hidden from view. 
br	Federation of Ontario Naturalists Birds of the African Rain Forests Covers a few forest species that can be found in Ethiopia While I took all the above and listened to them on the drive northwards, I never found it necessary to refer to them while in Ethiopia - any  bird  heard < calling > proved easy to see within minutes - so there was no point in luring any of them out with a tape. 
br	Black francolin : although the  birds  were not < calling >, I got the impression that any early morning drive along farm tracks in the west of the island would be likely to produce this species. 
br	There were at least 2  birds   <calling >, but we had only a fleeting glimpse of one. 
br	For about 10 minutes we could hear the  bird   <calling > close by but couldn't see it, and the sound didn't seem to be moving! 
br	Suddenly the  bird  stopped < calling > and we waited another 15 minutes while playing back his call. 
br	The  bird  was < calling > near a rocky outcrop just beyond the wooden huts adjacent to the hotel restaurant. 
br	The Mangroves were disappointing, Mr Dai explained that early December was one of the worst times as the winterers had not yet arrived and the breeding  birds  were not < calling > or displaying . Mr Dai saved the day by taking us out into Krabi Bay and showing us Chinese Egret and Nordmann's Greenshank. 
br	Peter was a good person to go birding with, without him I think I would have struggled in Khao Yai but he knows most of the  bird   <calls >. 
br	A common and widespread species in Antigua, perched  birds  often heard < calling >. 
br	Eventually I got a brief view of a small dark brown  bird   <calling > incessantly in the dark brown undergrowth.

br	Once we were all out of the truck, the  birds   <called > again and sounded quite far away. 
br	Pay attention to eye-color, eyebrow, overall tint, bill-shape and species-specific marks (pale-tipped tyrannulet for example) Tiny-tyrant manakin -- huge lek at Witi kreek 2.7 to 3.1 Capuchin  bird  -- heard < calling > about 200 m right of MW 1.5/1.7 White bellbird -- hard to see, is all I can say.

br	That wolf  < called > again and scared me half to death. 
br	We heard  birds   <calling > at two locations on the way up but were unable to find their perch and experienced similar frustration on the way down. 
br	Eventually there was no choice, so with the assistance of Edson's machete we clambered down into the forest and then up the next slope until we could at last see where the  birds  were < calling > from.

doc#20464	Because of the decisions made by the Rabbinical Council and Rabbi Hillel II in 358 A.D., in the modern astronomically-based Jewish calendar, Passover (Nisan 14) can only < fall on a Monday >, Wednesday, Friday, or Sabbath. 
doc#20464	Therefore, Nisan 16 -- the day of the wave sheaf offering -- can only < fall on a Wednesday >, Friday, Sunday, or Monday. 
doc#20464	Thus in Bible times, the day of the Passover sacrifice could < fall on a Thursday >, even though it could not do so today, because of the "postponements" added by Hillel II.

doc#20464	Since the days of Hillel II, however, this problem no longer exists, since the 9th of Av can no longer < fall on a Friday >, due to the "postponements." 
doc#20464	This halachic requirement, which was extant in Temple times, permitted Jews to cut short their fast on the 9th of Av, when it < fell on a Friday >. 
doc#20464	In those days, Hoshana Rabbah could fall on a Sabbath, and Yom Kippur could < fall on a Friday > or a Sunday!

br	Just in front of Mrs. James Williams < sat a girl > in a loose tan jacket and a straw hat adorned with grapes and roses. 
br	All these persons made a great deal of noise, and talked among themselves as though there were no one else in the boat; yet close beside them < sat a man > of great importance in the district, a stout burgher of Bruges, wrapped about with a vast cloak. 
br	Immediately behind him < sat a peasant > and his son, a boy ten years of age.

br	" It came from the lower end of the table, where there < sat a group > of minor tradesmen who, although part of the company, appeared to be a little below the social level of the others; and who seemed to nourish a certain independence of opinion and carry on discussions not quite in harmony with those at the head; just as the west end of a church is sometimes persistently found to sing out of time and tune with the leading spirits in the chancel. 
br	He lifted the lid of the large, square, but oddly flat box, and inside < sat a manila > folder.

br	One gleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged mast, on which < sat a cormorant >, dark and large, with wings flecked with foam; its beak held a gold bracelet set with gems, that I had touched with as brilliant tints as my palette could yield, and as glittering distinctness as my pencil could impart. 
br	There were two study tables, both long and flanked with benches; over the centre of each hung a lamp; beneath this lamp, on either side the table, < sat a teacher >; the girls were arranged to the right hand and the left; the eldest and most studious nearest the lamps or tropics; the idlers and little ones towards the north and south poles. 
br	On the table < sits a file >, a plastic bag, a piece of paper and a bottle.

br	In 1697, the great astronomer Edmund Halley - he of comet fame- < sat on > this very spot and observed a rare triple rainbow: "On the Sixth Day of August last, in the Evening, between Six and Seven of the Clock, I went to take the air upon the Walls of Chester, when I was surprized by a sudden shower, which forced me to take shelter in a Nich that afforded me a seat in the Wall, near the North East Corner thereof. 
br	As I < sat there >, I observed an Iris, exceedingly vivid, as to its Colours, at first on the South Side only, but in a little time with an entire arch... 
br	Also here were Austral Thrushes , House Wren , Shiny Cowbird , a very showy Common Diuca-Finch , White-crested Elaenia , and some distant Chilean Mockingbirds . An Austral Pygmy-Owl started calling and thankfully it was spotted by John < sat in > a tall eucalyptus tree, where we managed to scope it. 
br	From a rocky footpath we could easily scope the colony of Humboldt Penguins which were there, and a Blackish Oystercatcher < sat on > top of a rock. 
br	Several Chilean Pigeons were seen, but the light was poor, although a CaliforniaQuail < sat in > a tree was closer and easier to see. 
br	One of the first species seen was a male Band-tailed Sierra-Finch < sat on > a fence post. 
br	Eventually we had to leave but not before getting some excellent views of a pair of Flightless Steamer-Ducks < sat on > a rock. 
br	Along the way we passed close by the shore, and < sat on > the calm water just a few feet from the edge were many Antarctic Giant-Petrels , SootyShearwaters and Southern Fulmars. 
br	The inevitable roadside stops produced views of Flying Steamer-Ducks , Crested Ducks , Great Grebes and then a group of ten Antarctic Giant-Petrels feeding just a few yards from shore, followed by some beautiful DolphinGulls < sat on > a jetty. 
br	Moving on a little further a Least Seedsnipe was seen < sat on > its nest and then I spotted our target species, the very rare and endangered dove-like Magellanic Plover. 
br	Further along Andy (refreshed by an apple) spotted a raptor < sat on > a post. 
br	It wasn't long before we made a short stop for an immature Rufous-tailed Hawk < sat on > a telegraph pole. 
br	A Chilean Skua < sat on > the flat water allowing excellent scope views, while a SouthernFulmar was also noted, as was as a couple of Dolphin Gulls. 
br	The young man and the young girl who < sat together > on the low tombstone looked at each other.

br	In a room, all white wainscot and crimson wall-paper, a perfect gem of colour after the black, empty darkness in which I had been groping, a pretty girl was telling a story, as well as I could make out, to an attentive child upon her knee, while an old woman < sat placidly > dozing over the fire. 
br	We had not < sat long >, but he got up, and, stopping my very breath with kisses, threw me upon the bed again; but then being both well warmed, he went farther with me than decency permits me to mention, nor had it been in my power to have denied him at that moment, had he offered much more than he did.

br	Dr. Schwenninger feels that the sermon by Bishop Galen had a good deal to do with curbing the large scale exterminations in the spring of 1942, but he feels that Stalingrad and the consequent increased need for manpower, which drew a lot of the SS personnel who < sat in > these organizations to the war fronts, had still more to do with reducing the organized extermination activities.

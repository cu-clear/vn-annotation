br	She < sat down > and cried for a while. 
br	There were two single women who showed up and < sat behind > me. 
br	She < sat on > the bunk and fidgeted with her fingers.

br	Adam Rosa 03-04-2004, 09:41 PM FAO - The Animal : The rest of us have all got together, < sat down > and discussed this. 
br	I < sat on > it and, as it has such a low seat, immediately felt comfortable on it. 
br	This is the first time I have ever < sat down > and really thought about telling other people what can happen. 
br	But he did, as he < sat back > resting his shoulders against the rock and gazing out from the mouth of the cave where they had made themselves comfortable at the beautiful sunlit veldt, till it all grew dark as if a veil had been drawn over his eyes. 
br	I < sat down > and turned over two large portfolios of political caricatures. 
br	" The chuckle with which he said this, and the chuckle with which he paid for the Turkey, and the chuckle with which he paid for the cab, and the chuckle with which he recompensed the boy, were only to be exceeded by the chuckle with which he < sat down > breathless in his chair again, and chuckled till he cried. 
br	Jack < sat back >, quietly enjoying watching the linguist at work. 
br	It was quite a glamorous setting and it's very intense for the actors to sit there with people all night and I think we created an environment that made them feel comfortable and it was dignified and they < sat at > tables and had proper adult conversations and they came away from it and had a great time. 
br	As the driver began to fix it I ran over to look down on the fast flowing river below, and as I had hoped there were a pair of Torrent Ducks < sat on > a boulder in the middle of the river. 
br	Two Southern Crested Caracaras were also seen being mobbed by their smaller cousins, and we stopped to admire a very smart Short-eared Owl < sat on > a fence post. 
br	I < sat at > the table fronting them; and, as I looked, I grew absorbed. 
br	It may seem odd that many of us haven't got to know each other before hand, and this is partly down to the coach which features very high chairs that discourage communication other than with the person < sat right > beside you, and partly because of the lack of any formal arrangements in the evenings, when many travellers seem to disappear to their rooms to watch TV (or write web logs! 
br	The Medieval 'Lives' say that Beuno < sat on > this stone when he told Winifred that anyone coming to the Well and asking something in her name, 'might receive an answer to their request at least at the third time'. 
br	For me, I <sat> down in an armchair, and as I  sat there , half-dazed, Josef clipped and scraped me till my moustache and imperial were things of the past and my face was as bare as the King's. 
br	More children < sat on > the stage, dangling their legs... 
br	I < sat down > and wrote my order. 
br	Glancing over to the empty stage I felt sorry for Phillipa Boyens' son Callum as, wearily, he < sat on > the road leaning against the stage done up in suit and tie, trying to grab what little shade was available. 
br	The wolves converged upon him, and < sat on > their haunches in a half circle as a great, battle-scarred animal approached him and looked up into his face.

br	One day after this, as she came into the room where all we poor children were at work, she < sat down > just over against me, not in her usual place as mistress, but as if she set herself on purpose to observe me and see me work. 
br	Turning right we < sat on > the seat taking in the panoramic views of the countryside. 
br	In the end we used a plastic bag on the seat and granny < sat on > it and was able to twist round like using a swivle seat but much more comfortable. 
br	And then a cosmopolite < sat in > one of them, and I was glad, for I held a theory that since Adam no true citizen of the world has existed. 
br	They who < sat at > her tables spoke to her briefly. with quotations from the bill of fare; and then raised their voices in honeyed and otherwise-flavoured accents, eloquently addressed to the fair Aileen. 
br	He was too diffident to aspire to Aileen's notice; so he usually < sat at > one of Tildy's tables, where he devoted himself to silence and boiled weakfish. 
br	He < sat at > a worm-eaten desk, covered with files of waiters' checks so old that I was sure the bottomest one was for clams that Hendrik Hudson had eaten and paid for. 
br	I could not walk, so I hobbled into a restaurant and < sat there > until I was better. 
br	" The two girls < sat in > the window seat, looking out at the lights and the stream of hurrying vehicles in the avenue.

br	" O'Neill nodded thoughtfully and < sat down > again. 
br	People < sat down > and blockaded New Street. 
br	He handed one of the bottles to him then < sat down > opposite. 
br	I < sat just > behind them, so I could not help hearing what they were saying. 
br	Now I will come onto, James, your point about - well, I will deal with your point about - the Official Secrets Act straight away really because, as I said when you < sat down >, I thought you had made an arguable case about the rest but you spoilt it by going completely over the top. 
br	After this there was nothing more to be done but to wait till darkness fell, and they < sat back > watching while the sentry was again changed, when the fresh man visited the wagon, to climb in, look carefully round, and eye them suspiciously before returning to his post. 
br	She stirred the fire, and shut the door, and < sat as > near to it as she could, quite on the edge of her chair. 
br	The Boy < sat at > our table, refusing nourishment of any kind, and apologised for his low state, suggesting that we others continue while he recuperated and joined us in a few days by train. 
br	The old woman < sat on > the spinning chair near the fire with a basket of apples by her side. 
br	" He handed her the coffee and she < sat down > next to him. 
br	As soon as three had arrived, we < sat down > to "Preference," I being the unlucky fourth. 
br	All of a sudden my imagination was caught by the aspect of a guest who < sat directly > in front of me. 
br	But when they wanted me to sing I was too embarrassed and I'd have to go and sit in the toilet and sing from there with the door open, whilst the others < sat in > the other room listening to me. 
br	[laughter] HM You know if, when you < sat down > to write, you asked yourself 'whither the novel? 
br	EW Well, echoing what Hilary says, and also as a writer of fiction, I don't think, when I read books, I don't have any idea that their authors have < sat down > and thought 'now, what sort of a novel shall I write?

br	classmates told me about him: Elena: The teacher told us to sit with whomever we want, and we did that and some, because Andreas sits alone at the back, they don't play with him and they make fun of him some times, and the teacher did not tell us where to sit, because before he used to tell us and now he told us to sit as we want, and that pupil did not go anywhere because nobody told him to sit with him, although there were seats and he < sat on > his own at the back.

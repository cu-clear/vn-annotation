br	At last the pale streak right in front warned them that daylight was coming on fast, and they searched the country as they cantered on till away more to the north a rugged eminence clearly seen against the sky < suggested >  itself  as the sort of spot they required, and they now hurried their ponies on till they came to a rushing, bubbling stream running in the right direction.

br	This is barely a beginning, however, and other large issues immediately < suggest >  themselves  -- not least the nature of response to changing statutory frameworks which effectively removed the legal though not necessarily the social and communal obligation of church attendance and also the impact of theological change on both clerical and lay perceptions of the task of the Church.

br	Two possible explanations < suggest >  themselves  : either their conversion to Nonconformity led them to play down the surviving elements of 'Popish superstition' as much as possible (against which maybe argued the fact that the Melchiors made no effort to suppress the cult); or, as the 'hereditary keepers' of the relic they may have been reluctant to expose the relic, and incidentally themselves, to the possible ridicule of 'enlightened' outsiders - numbers of similar ancient popular cults in Ireland came to a sudden end as a result of enlightened 19th-century interference. 
br	Two appealing characters had < suggested >  themselves  , a woman and a man, Alicia and Roman, who live in Wychwood, which is a city the size of Toronto, who clamour and romp and cling to the island that is their life's predicament - they long for love, but seffishly strive for self-preservation.

br	Of course Mr. Larkin would not put the case exactly that way, but no other way < suggested >  itself  to him, so he abstained from what he knew or felt would be the dangers of definition.

br	Of course, the observation here very naturally < suggests >  itself  , that, if the colours and markings of species have a definite use (which, in some instances, is sufficiently obvious even to our comprehension), then, we might reasonably expect to find that resemblance which is found to subsist between those of species whose habits are almost the same. 
br	Furthermore, as I have argued elsewhere ( Pilcher, 1994a ), if the sociology of cohort influences on socio-political orientation is a sub-field of the sociology of knowledge, then a methodological approach suited to the interpretation of meaning < suggests >  itself  as the most appropriate method of investigation, with a particular focus on the words, vocabularies or discourses employed ( Mannheim, 1960 ; Mills, 1967a, 1967b ; Dant, 1991 ). 
br	He probably said to himself, moreover, that, even if he dismissed his army, he did not let it wholly out of his hand, and could in case of need still raise a force ready for battle sooner at any rate than any other party-chief; that the democracy was waiting in submissive attitude for his signal, and that he could deal with the refractory senate even without soldiers; and such further considerations as < suggested >  themselves  , in which there was exactly enough of truth to make them appear plausible to one who wished to deceive himself.

br	My immediately response to this sorry state of affairs was to think about a music which could use certain of the Durer woodcuts by way of illumination, and in mid October 2005 the material I was recording for Hinterlands < suggested >  itself  as a likely candidate. vi) How I related the Durer woodcuts to the landscapes of my Northumbrian childhood is consequent, no doubt, on a deeper yearning which I had no other way of experiencing at the time.

br	Casey's own view is that 6:51-58 is 'a climax in the eucharist' but that this sacramental theology has been 'expounded in stages' throughout the earlier sections of John 6. 5 The starting points for both scholars are so different that it is hard not to feel there is something of a methodological impasse here; nevertheless, some criticisms of Casey's critique < suggest >  themselves  . 
br	The first explanation that < suggested >  itself  was that this tone is a combination tone. 
br	Contradictions Are Impossible Then the question very naturally < suggests >  itself  : Why did not God create us so that we could not think negative or destructive thoughts?

br	Three levels of analysis < suggest >  themselves  here then (and here I draw loosely on Dowling, 1995). 
br	This diagram, which has been constructed to represent intuitively or semi-intuitively the same relations which are abstractly expressed in the premisses, is then observed, and a hypothesis < suggests >  itself  that there is a certain relation between some of its parts--or perhaps this hypothesis had already been suggested.

br	It might be a clever satire on British film comedy but it hardly < suggests >  itself  as a superior alternative. 
br	This can be outlined briefly as offering three distinct stances in the act of communication: a locutionary act ('he said that'); an illocutionary act ('he argued that'); and a perlocutionary act ('he convinced me that'), which may be part of the same illocutionary act. 35 When this general understanding of speech-act theory is theologically and covenantally construed, then at least two important avenues of thought < suggest >  themselves  . 
br	"by right" are taken as a matter of right . The transition is from the belief that I may do something because it is right, in other words, to the belief that I may do something because I have a right to do it ... Thus the concept of rights joins the concept of the right .

br	Within the European context, however, a number of measures < suggest >  themselves  . 
br	In conclusion, although this was something entirely new to us, the pedagogical methodology and ideas < suggested >  themselves  quite readily; the project highlighted the importance of tightly integrating any novel activities with the course structure; the biggest problems were essentially in overcoming anxieties in implementing something innovative into a set curriculum and attaching a value (i.e. assessment mark) to it. 
br	Occasionally a formal debate will < suggest >  itself  , and this should be handled precisely and formally. 
br	But Cormack's own violent incursions into Catholic neighbourhoods and combination of electoral intervention with control of the streets < suggested >  themselves  'at least an outline of a Protestant variety of fascism' (1) .

	If there's a thematic line running through his work, maybe it's the focus on heroes - Deckard in Blade Runner, Ripley in Alien, even girl gladiator Jordan O'Neil in GI Jane - who put their necks on the line for corrupt organisations that don't deserve their loyalty (an allegory of the sacrifice film-makers make for studios and the braying spectator mob < suggests >  itself  ).

br	If then the supreme purpose of God is the exaltation of Christ, "that in all things He may have the pre-eminence," the startling question < suggests >  itself  whether the disasters which sometimes befall the best of men when they take up the cult of the Holy Spirit may not be due to the fact that this is a departure from the line of that divine purpose.

br	For the duo records, besides the duo with Braxton on Leo already mentioned, there is Compatibles, the final collaboration with Derek Bailey still available on a Incus Lp, and it kind of sums up a very long and fruitful relationship; another Fmp, Chirps, with Lacy, < suggest >  itself  , but the very different Hall Of Mirrors with Walter Prati on electronics would be worth the search: in it Parker is confronted with a processed/ multiplied image built on a fragment of his own improvisation, with very intere sting results.
